# [OSPBench: Open Stream Processing Benchmark](https://github.com/Klarrio/open-stream-processing-benchmark/wiki)

This repository contains the code of the open stream processing benchmark.

All documentation can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/Klarrio/open-stream-processing-benchmark/wiki).

This code base includes:
- benchmark pipeline implementations: 
- data stream generator to generate input streams locally or on a DC/OS cluster
- Kafka scripts to start a cluster and read from a topic for local development

Currently the benchmark includes Apache Spark (Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming), Apache Flink and Kafka Streams.

Documentation on running the benchmark locally can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/Klarrio/open-stream-processing-benchmark/wiki/Architecture-and-deployment).
